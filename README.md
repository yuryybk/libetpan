## LibEtPan

Extended fork of the [libetpan](https://github.com/dinhviethoa/libetpan) library.

## What is different?

- Added [configuration](https://github.com/yuryybk/libetpan/tree/master/build-android/dependencies/iconv) to build `libetpan` for Android with [iconv](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) by default.
